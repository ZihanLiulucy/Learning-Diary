## Summary

### SAR Basics

SAR is a radar device, and its primary measures are the backscattered signal's intensity (or amplitude) and phase, which are sampled in time bins along the azimuth (the direction the sensor antenna is tracking) and range (the direction of the sensor antenna is either across the track or perpendicular to it) [@GoogleEarthEngineSARBasics2023].The "Synthetic Aperture" of the SAR refers to using the motion of the sensor to virtually create a large antenna [@GoogleEarthEngineSARBasics2023].

SAR captures the backscattering energy of ground objects, which is related to surface roughness, complex dielectric constant and moisture of ground objects [@MoreiraEtAl2013]. As it travels, it continuously sends and receives signals, creating detailed images of buildings, roads, and other structures, even in the absence of sunlight or through cloud cover, and is able to obtain data all day and all weather due to its long wavelength [@WuEtAl2022].

### SAR Polarization

Polarization refers to the orientation of the electromagnetic wave, which can be vertical, horizontal, or circular. Different surfaces reflect these polarized waves differently, aiding in identifying materials and conditions.

Rough scattering (e.g. bare earth) is most sensitive to VV; Volume scattering (e.g. leaves) is most sensitive to cross-polarizations: VH or HV; Double bounce scattering (e.g. trees / buildings) is most sensitive to HH.

From a student's question during the class, comparing SAR images over time reveals structural changes: sudden shifts in VV and HH backscatter indicate damage, while gradual changes suggest construction or renovation.

### Understanding SAR Data

SAR data's amplitude (or backscatter) provides information about the surface properties, while the phase data helps determine the precise distance of the reflecting surface from the satellite.

### Change Detection with SAR

Change detection in SAR involves comparing images from different times to identify changes. Directly subtracting one image from another can be misleading due to SAR's unique properties, so statistical methods are used.

t-tests: is used to determine if there are significant differences between two sets of data, comparing SAR images of an area before and after a natural disaster using t-tests can reveal the extent of changes or damages.

Standard Deviation: measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset. Analyzing the standard deviation over time across a series of images can help identify areas of high variability, indicating potential changes or unusual activities.

It shows the level of building changing in York, the more yellow the pixel is, the more change the building has experienced. The purple parts shows very little or no change.

### Image Fusion

Image fusion in the context of SAR and optical data integration is a process where information from both types of imagery is combined to produce a single output that contains more comprehensive information than either of the individual images.

#### Decision Level Fusion

After processing and analyzing both SAR and optical images independently, the information is combined to make a final decision or analysis.

#### Object Level Fusion

First extracting texture, shape, and other features from source images, then combining them to create new features using layer-stacking for LCC or ensemble learning [@LinEtAl2020].

#### Pixel Level Fusion

Direct combination of pixel values from SAR and optical images, often using sophisticated algorithms to retain important features from both. According to [@KulkarniRege2020], it includes component substitution, transforming images and swapping structural parts with SAR data; multi-scale decomposition, breaking images into sub-bands for fusion and reconstruction; hybrid methods, combining multiple techniques for efficient fusion; and model-based methods, using sparse representation or energy optimization for fusion. Hybrid methods are preferred for their balance of low computational load and good performance.

## Application

### Application 1

SAR can be applies in Volcanology [@PinelEtAl2014]. Studies on volcanic surfaces using satellite SAR have traditionally used co-polarized data (HH or VV), which transmit and receive in the same polarization. However, airborne SAR research shows that cross-polarized data (HV or VH) more effectively differentiate lava flow textures and roughness. RADARSAT-2 images from Kīlauea Volcano, Hawai'i, highlighted the advantage of cross-polarized data in distinguishing between 'a'ā and pāhoehoe lava flows, and between active flows and surrounding vegetation, regardless of time or weather.

RADARSAT-2 images from July 7, 2010, show Kīlauea Volcano, revealing surface roughness differences between 'a'ā and pāhoehoe lava flows, with variations in shading best seen in cross-polarized data.

RADARSAT-2 images from January 23, 2014, show the active lava from the Pu'u 'Ō'ō eruption, with cross-polarized data clearly delineating flow margins against the forest due to backscatter contrast.

### Application 2

In another study [@SinghroyMolch2004], InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) is used to monitor and characterize landslides in the Canadian Rockies, aiding in understanding landslide mechanisms and distribution. A near-circular fringe was detected in the revised differential interferogram by the InSAR investigation (Fig. 1). The highest displacement values that correspond to this are at −1.3 cm, suggesting that the rock face may have moved gradually before the rock fall in 2001.

### Application reflection

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is versatile in geoscience for surface and texture mapping, with co-polarized data (HH, VV) traditionally used in volcanology. However, cross-polarized data (HV, VH) better distinguishes lava flows and vegetation. In-SAR is excellent at monitoring subtle ground movements, as seen in its detection of pre-damage landslide deformation in the Canadian Rockies. Both techniques are very valuable in earth observation, providing complementary data for the study of dynamic geological processes on different environmental conditions.

## Reflection:

Through my studies, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of SAR's capabilities in capturing ground object backscattering, crucial for analyzing surface roughness and changes, particularly in volcanic and landslide monitoring. Learning about SAR's amplitude and phase aspects enriched my comprehension of how these elements are crucial in differentiating surface features and monitoring environmental changes.

The distinction between co-polarized and cross-polarized data was particularly interesting, showing how each applied in different analytical requirements, with cross-polarized data proving more effective in certain contexts. The extended learning of in-SAR which extends the capabilities of SAR by using the phase difference between two or more SAR images taken from slightly different viewpoints to create interferograms, can solve the Jakarta urban issue from week 4 (city seeking). This comprehensive understanding helps to understand the potential of SAR in environment study and geospatial science.
