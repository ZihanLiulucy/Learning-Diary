The definition of remote sensing

## Summary：

### definatiuon and formular

Remotely sensed images and the corresponding analytical techniques offer a comprehensive approach to observing and monitoring urban environments in real-time through high spatial-temporal-spectral-resolution data. There are passive sensor and active sensors, which the difference is the passive sensor reflect energy from the sun, but active sensors Actively emits electormagentic waves and then waits to receive them.Remotely sensed data and applications will vary based on the four resolutions: spatial, spectral, temporal, radiometric. Every feature on earth will have a unique spectral signature, We classify the type or spectral resolution based on the number of bands it observes, can be discrete or continuous

Λ(wavelength) = c (velocity of light) / v (frequency)

### wavelengths and color

On the way prior to hitting the sensor, energy maybe absorbed by the surface or can be scattered by particles in the atmosphere e.g. Why the sky is blue: blue hues have smaller wavelengths which can scatter easier. In contrast, when the sun's angle changes the blue light scatter doesn't reach our eyes as the distance is increased , so longer wavelengths like reds and oranges can be seen as they are the longest wavelengths. We can see the color since there is atmosphere so molecules scatter the light. The other colors are scattered so we can only see orange or red color.

### difficulty of getting remote sensed data

However, in UK, there are always many clouds, together with many other reasons, many interactions are influencing the data since the atmosphere block parts of the the spectrum.

## Application:

International society for photogrammetry and remote sensing (ISPRS)

The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences (ISPRS Archives) is the series of peer-reviewed proceedings published by the International Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS). I am interested in disaster, so I picked Gi4DM 2020 -- 13th GeoInformation for Disaster Management conference.

Across the world, nature-triggered disasters fuelled by climate change are worsening. Some two billion people have been affected by the consequences of natural hazards over the last ten years, 95% of which were weather-related (such as floods and windstorms).

Australia frequently experiences extended periods of severe droughts which have a significant negative impact on populations and economy. Drought indicators selected to compute drought hazard -- the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) and Soil Moisture -- were obtained through the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Space-based Weather and Climate Extremes Monitoring (SWCEM) international initiative.

To decrease the frequency of disaster and decline the negative results to economy and residents, remote sense data is also used to evaluate the nature. For instance,  Land cover maps, derived from remote sensing data, are essential for understanding long-term changes in vegetation cover and land use and assessing the impact of land use changes on grassland ecosystems.

Understanding habitat dynamics in space and time is crucial for assessing the protection measures' effectiveness and supporting the definition of sustainable management practices (Orsenigo et al. Citation2018). Earth observation by satellite remote sensing (RS) offers many possibilities for cost-effective, timely, and reproducible vegetation analysis (Royimani, Mutanga, and Dube Citation2021; Vizzari Citation2022). Grassland remote sensing research may substantially support ecological studies because it utilizes multi-platform, multi-sensor, and multi-temporal satellite remote sensing data sources and ground observation data, through remote sensing inversion and data assimilation (Li et al. Citation2021).

The two articles Critically analyzing both paragraphs, the integration of remote sensing in disaster assessment and management is evident. In the first paragraph, remote sensing data, particularly from the WMO initiative, is utilized for monitoring drought indicators. The second paragraph expands on the broader applications of remote sensing, particularly in assessing land cover changes and vegetation dynamics. The incorporation of citations adds credibility to the information provided. However, both papers lack specific details on the spatial and temporal resolutions, or the potential challenges associated with remote sensing applications.
